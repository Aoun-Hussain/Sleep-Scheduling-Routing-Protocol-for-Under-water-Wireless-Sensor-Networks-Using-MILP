# Sleep-Scheduling-Routing-Protocol-for-Under-water-Wireless-Sensor-Networks-Using-Mixed-Integer-Linea
The code uses Python's PuLP library to solve an integer program for energy optimization of an Under-water Wireless Sensor Network. The optimization problem modeled on the Under-water Wirless Sensor Network is a novel and crucial application for oil leak detection in an ocean.
